Tool for sorting out cat photos from your photo collection using pre-trained PyTorch model.

## Why?

Why not?

## How does it work?

It is based on excellent [Detecto](https://detecto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package, which in turn uses [Faster R-CNN ResNet-50 FPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) to label objects found in the image. 

Our tool runs the photo through the model and looks through the top labels to see if there is a `cat` amongst them. If it is the case, photo will be copied/moved to the appropriate directory.

False positive rate is ~9%, but that is enough for you to sort through them by hand.

## Usage

```
â‡’  catpossible --help
Usage: catpossible [OPTIONS] PHOTO_DIR

Options:
  -d, --dest PATH  Destination for found cat photos (default: current dir).
  -m / --move      Move found cat photos instead of copying.
  --help           Show this message and exit.
```
